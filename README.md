# GifTastic

The app will take the topics in the array and create buttons in the HTML.

When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

Under every gif its rating will be displayed. 

The user has the option of adding more buttons.
